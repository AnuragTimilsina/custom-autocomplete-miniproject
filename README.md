# custom-autocomplete-miniproject
## Custom auto complete using Trie data structure and flask.

### This is the repo for the 3rd sem mini project where I had to make a trie data structure. However, I used the same data structure to simulate a custom autocomplete in a web app made with a flask web framework. This app returns the contact info of all KUCE2019 students with just some initial prefixes. This app uses trie data structure independently and no DBMS engine is used during the query.
